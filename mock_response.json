  "summary_text":  "In the summer of 1922, the American Dream shimmers like a mirage across the glittering landscape of Long Island's wealthy enclaves. I am Nick Carraway, a Midwesterner who has moved to New York to become a bond trader, and I find myself drawn into a world of extraordinary wealth, desperate longing, and tragic illusion.

My neighbor is Jay Gatsby, a mysterious millionaire whose lavish parties draw hundreds of guests to his mansion, yet he remains an enigma. Behind his extravagant facade lies a singular, consuming passion: to win back Daisy Buchanan, the woman he loved years ago before going off to war. Daisy is now married to Tom Buchanan, a brutish, wealthy man from an old money family, who maintains a callous affair with Myrtle Wilson, a working-class woman from Queens.

Gatsby's entire life has been constructed around one goal: to recreate the perfect moment he shared with Daisy before the war. His massive estate, his elaborate parties, his carefully cultivated persona—all are designed to attract her attention and demonstrate his newfound wealth. He has reinvented himself completely, rising from poverty to phenomenal riches through mysterious means, likely connected to bootlegging during Prohibition.

When I help reconnect Gatsby and Daisy, they begin a passionate affair. The tension builds to a catastrophic confrontation where Gatsby's dream begins to unravel. During a heated encounter, Tom reveals Gatsby's criminal connections, shattering the romantic illusion Daisy has briefly entertained.

The tragedy culminates when Daisy, driving Gatsby's car, accidentally kills Myrtle Wilson. Myrtle's husband George, believing Gatsby was responsible, murders Gatsby and then kills himself. In the end, Gatsby dies alone, with only me and his father attending his funeral—a stark contrast to the hundreds who attended his parties.

The novel is a profound critique of the American Dream, revealing how the pursuit of wealth and status often masks deeper emotional emptiness. Gatsby represents the quintessential self-made man, transforming himself from James Gatz, a poor Midwestern farm boy, into Jay Gatsby, a wealthy sophisticate. Yet his wealth cannot purchase love or genuine social acceptance.

Fitzgerald exposes the moral bankruptcy of the era's upper class—their carelessness, their casual cruelty, their ability to destroy lives and then retreat into their privileged safety. The green light at the end of Daisy's dock, which Gatsby longingly watches, becomes a powerful symbol of unattainable dreams and the eternal human struggle between aspiration and reality.

Ultimately, the novel is a tragic meditation on the hollowness of the American Dream, the impossibility of recapturing the past, and the destructive power of unchecked desire. Gatsby's fatal flaw is his inability to accept that some dreams are best left in memory, that the past cannot be reconstructed, no matter how desperately one might wish it."
